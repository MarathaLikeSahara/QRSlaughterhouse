For Bulk QR Code Decoding

To utilize this project, you need to install the pyzbar and opencv-python-headless through pip

Also, you need to create a folder called images under the main directory.

Then, put the images of QRcode inside the "images" you just created and then hit the run button.

I'm a total beginner, and actually this project is for me to practice how to use git.
